## Project Structure

```
assets/        # Contains all images and assets used in the project
css/           # Stylesheets
  main.css     # Main CSS file
js/            # JavaScript files
  main.js      # Script for rendering links
  links.js     # Links data
index.html     # Main HTML file
```

---

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the app, including placeholders for dynamically generated links.
2. **Dynamic Links**: The `links.js` file holds an array of objects, each representing a link with a name, URL, and image. These are dynamically rendered in `main.js`.
3. **Styling**: The `main.css` file defines the styles for the app, including responsiveness and hover effects.
4. **Deployment**: The app is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.

```javascript

    name: "Platform Name",
    link: "https://example.com",
